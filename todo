After reviewing the script, it seems that there are some key steps missing in the implementation of the MD5 algorithm. Here is an overview of what is missing and what needs to be done:

Complete the processing of the 64-byte blocks: The current script only prepares and reads the 64-byte blocks but does not perform the MD5 algorithm operations on these blocks. You need to add the main loop that performs the four rounds of the MD5 algorithm for each block.

Implement the auxiliary functions F, G, H, and I: The MD5 algorithm uses four auxiliary functions F, G, H, and I. These functions take three 32-bit input variables and return a 32-bit value. These functions are not implemented in the script and should be added.

Perform the shift and modular addition operations: The MD5 algorithm requires circular shift operations and 32-bit modular addition. Ensure that these operations are correctly implemented in the script.

Format and display the result: Once all the operations have been performed on the 64-byte blocks and the values of A, B, C, and D have been updated, you need to combine these values into the final 128-bit MD5 hash and format it as a 32-character hexadecimal string.

Please note that implementing a cryptographic algorithm in a language like Windows Batch is complicated and error-prone. As mentioned earlier, it would be advisable to use a more suitable and efficient programming language to implement the MD5 algorithm. Additionally, for practical purposes, most modern programming languages already have cryptographic libraries that include MD5 implementations, allowing you to avoid the need to implement the algorithm from scratch.
